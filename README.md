## Overview

The [tesselle](https://www.tesselle.org/) suite is a collection of
packages for research and teaching in archaeology. These packages focus
on quantitative analysis methods developed for archaeology. The tesselle
packages are designed to work seamlessly together and to complement
general-purpose and other specialized statistical packages. These
packages can be used to explore and analyze common data types in
archaeology: count data, compositional data and chronological data..

The **tesselle** package is designed to make it easy to install and load
key packages from the tesselle suite in a single step.
